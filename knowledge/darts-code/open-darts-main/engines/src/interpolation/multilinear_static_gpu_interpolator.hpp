/**
 * @brief  Piecewise mulitlinear interpolator for GPU with static storage
 * 
 * Static storage is initialized in init() method. Two-level storage is used: 
 * with operator data at every supporting point (on host only) and with operator data at all vertices of every hypercube (on device only)
 * point data may be assigned externally after construction and before init() call to save time
 * hypercube storage then is initialized only  and much faster, as does not involve computation of supporting points,
 * only copying
 * 
 * @tparam index_t type used for indexing of supporting points and hypercubes
 * @tparam value_t value type used for supporting point storage, hypercube storage and interpolation
 * @tparam N_DIMS The number of dimensions in paramter space
 * @tparam N_OPS The number of operators to be interpolated
