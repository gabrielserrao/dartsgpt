DARTS-flash is a standalone library for performing multiphase equilibrium and thermodynamic properties calculations from a range of thermodynamic models. DARTS-flash has interfaces in C++ and Python and it depends on `Eigen` and `Pybind11` libraries.

## Features
DARTS-flash has been developed primarily for simulation of flow and transport in CO2-sequestration and geothermal-related subsurface applications. The robustness and accuracy of thermodynamic modelling routines determine the robustness of the compositional simulation.
